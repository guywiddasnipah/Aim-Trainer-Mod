## Description  <a name="description"></a>

The Aim Trainer Mod is a one-of-a-kind mod for the game Venge.io. As opposed to the tons of other color-palette mods out there, this mod concept provides the player a whole new gameplay experience. A powerful interface, custom assets, clean textures, sounds and scripting usage, all while preserving performance is what makes this mod stand out among its counterparts. The mod is suitable for competitive and casual playstyles alike and provides players a significant advantage over the others.

## FAQ  <a name="faq"></a>

### 1. Is the mod safe to use?

The mod is totally safe to use as a casual, general or competitive mod alike. It complies with the Venge TOS fully and doesn't provide unfair vantage to its users.

### 2. Where is the mod's UI as [showcased](https://youtu.be/ndG35KIY_Fo) previously?

The mod doesn't contain the CSS UI modifications yet due to an ongoing issue with the Venge Client, wherein CSS properties are not fully supported. When this issue is patched, the CSS file for the UI will be added.

### 3. What's going to be the future for this mod? Is this the final version or are there going to be further additions?

For the time being, this is the final base release of the mod with complete assets, textures, sounds and scripts. We have more utility scripts planned to further improve gameplay experience. Any and all updates about that will be announced in the mod's discord server.

### 2. Can I use this mod's assets in my own mod? And can I release variants of the mod thus created?
