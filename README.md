## Description  <a name="description"></a>

The Aim Trainer Mod is a one-of-a-kind mod for the game Venge.io. As opposed to the tons of other color-palette mods out there, this mod concept provides the player a whole new gameplay experience. A powerful interface, custom assets, clean textures, sounds and scripting usage, all while preserving performance is what makes this mod stand out among its counterparts. The mod is suitable for competitive and casual playstyles alike and provides players a significant advantage over the others.

## FAQ  <a name="faq"></a>

### 1. What happened to this mod project?

The mod was archived until further notice following this [announcement](https://discord.com/channels/719544465856921692/719551901602938890/1261299076297658428) in the Venge official Discord server. The mod no longer meets the official mod-making guidelines and is considered of unfair usage due to major changes in the guidelines.

### 2. What made the mod be considered of unfair usage?

As stated in the official announcement, using any mods that use modified map assets will be considered cheating starting July 22, 2024. We do not want our mod users to be banned because of the mod. Hence it was taken down. <ins>**If you are still using the mod, its humbly advised that you do not do so furthermore and uninstall it immediately to prevent yourself from getting hacker-flagged**</ins>.

### 3. How do I uninstall the mod?

Delete the entire Venge Client folder from your PC's Documents folder. This will get rid of the mod wholly.

### 4. Is it not possible to adapt the mod to the new guidelines and re-release it?

As much as we would have loved to do so, its nearly impossible for us to provide our users the experience we aimed for while also keeping it in line with the new rules.

Our mod heavily relied on custom modelled map assets to provide enhanced gameplay performance and give a cleaner look to the maps. Some decorative assets were also removed from maps using jsons without significantly affecting their collisions, to further reduce render strain on the viewport.

But since these practices are no longer allowed, we had to take both of these asset types down. Without access to custom asset models, its also impossible for us to have custom textures for them. The weapon and character models were previously broken by another Venge update, which never got around to fixing because of the instability of the new animations system the update brought in. The CSS file, as mentioned before, didn't function fully because of issues with the client's CSS injector. What remained of the mod after all these deletions were just the sound files and the icon files.

This totally defeats our purpose of making the mod in the first place. We set out to make a mod that was aesthetically pleasing while also maintaining good performance. Based on community feedback, I think we achieved just that. But alas, its no longer possible for us to deliver that same experience back.

### 5. Will this mod ever be revived?

As of now, we don't know. We are hopeful that the Venge.io developers would rethink on their guidelines and amend them to to make modding fairer and more creative for everyone, including us. If such happens, and we are in a state of reviving the mod project while also making it fit the rules, then yes, we will revive this project.

Until then, the Github repository for this project will stay up, serving as a nice reminder of what the project was about, and as an info bulletin about the mod's discontinuation. We thank you all for your endless support and love to our mod project. This project was able to become a break-through in the Venge modding scene, only because of the beautiful and encouraging community behind it. Thank you all so much for sticking around! üíù
