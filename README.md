## FAQ  <a name="faq"></a>

### 1. What happened to this mod project?

The mod was archived until further notice following this [announcement](https://discord.com/channels/719544465856921692/719551901602938890/1261299076297658428) in the Venge official Discord server. The mod no longer meets the official mod-making guidelines and is considered of unfair usage due to major changes in the guidelines.

### 2. What made the mod be considered of unfair usage?

As stated in the official announcement, using any mods that use modified map assets will be considered cheating starting July 22, 2024. We do not want our mod users to be banned because of the mod. Hence it was taken down. <ins>**If you are still using the mod, its humbly advised that you do not do so furthermore and uninstall it immediately to prevent yourself from getting hacker-flagged.**</ins>

### 3. What's going to be the future for this mod? Is this the final version or are there going to be further additions?

For the time being, this is the final base release of the mod with complete assets, textures, sounds and scripts. We have more utility scripts planned to further improve gameplay experience. Any and all updates about that will be announced in the mod's discord server.

### 4. Can I use this mod's assets in my own mod? And can I release variants of the mod thus created?

The mod as a whole and all its contained files, including 3d assets, images, sounds and scripts are licensed under CC-BY Attribution License. As long as you provide appropriate credits and reference this mod as your source of resources, you're free to use the aforementioned assets in your own variants or projects. Read the license for further information regarding the same.

### 5. The mod seems to have broken character and weapon models. When will these be fixed?

The broken weapon and character models are the result of a recent Venge animations update, whereby character rigs and weapon entities were changed to facilitate the new animation system. This system in itself turned out to be pretty unstable and might be patched by the developers in the future. We too, are currently waiting for that patch to arrive since with this animation system, its nearly impossible for us to ship any working custom character or weapon models with the mod pack.
